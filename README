Semmy Purewal gave a talk to my local linux users group with some nice demonstrations of node.js. I decided to try reimplementing some of them in perl.

Some of the key Perl technologies are

AnyEvent https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::Intro - A framework for event-based programming
PSGI http://plackperl.org/ - An interface between web applications and servers
Plack http://plackperl.org/ - Low-level modules for using PSGI
Twiggy https://metacpan.org/module/Twiggy - AnyEvent HTTP server for PSGI
Mojolicious  http://mojolicio.us/ - A web framework that comes both with its own AnyEvent-compatible server and PSGI compatibilty

echo:       DONE
http:       DONE
httpplus:   DONE
twitter:    DONE
redis:      TODO
socket.io:  TODO
